The Senate requests the assistant principal for student affairs, in
conjunction with the assistant principal for buildings and facilities
and the Senate school climate committee, to organize an anti-litter
campaign and to recommend to the senate a program that in the future
would substantially reduce this litter. The Senate requests that the
assistant principal for student affairs report back to the Senate
within three Senate meetings on his plans for an anti-litter campaign
and the process of the anti-litter program.<br>

<p><font size="+1"><b>10-89</b> <b>Sense of the Senate (Not a
bill)</b><br>
The sense of the Senate regarding the exclusivity of X-block is that
scheduling meetings during this time stands to infringe upon the
integrity of the Senate as a governing power.<br>
The constitution states in article IV, section 3 that:<br>
<b><i>C. The scheduling of practices, rehearsals, and other required
meetings is strictly prohibited during Senate meeting times.<br>
E. No teacher shall be assigned any involuntary professional duty
while the Senate is in session.<br>
</i></b>It is the feeling of the Senate that, in order to protect the
integrity of the Senate, clarification of Article IV, Section 3 C is
necessary. Therefore we have stated that:<br>
<b><i>Any activity, extra-help or make-up session, detention,
practice, rehearsal, or meeting which is regularly scheduled and/or
offered only during X-block is considered in violation of the
Constitution.<br>
</i></b><br>

<p><font size="+1"><b>11-89 Snow Day Resolution</b><br>
In order to ensure the safety of students and staff, decisions
regarding school cancellations should be made based on the latest
weather information and forecasts, road conditions in neighboring
towns, and the Department of Public Works' assurance of cleared
roads, sidewalks, and school parking lots.<b><i><br>

<p><font size="+1"><b>3-90 Mandatory Assembly Bill</b><br>
During the school year, if the administration and/or a particular
department head or teacher wishes to make an assembly mandatory to
all students of a particular grade or grades, they must first obtain
the consent of the Student-Faculty Senate. Consent of the Senate
shall be by majority vote. Teachers will retain the right to take
their classes to a non-mandatory assembly. Students whose class as a
whole is not attending an assembly retain the privilege of attending
as an optional in-school field trip.<br>
<br>
The high school administration retains the right to call a mandatory
assembly in emergency and extraordinary circumstances when convening
a meeting of the Senate is not feasible or would be logistically
impossible.<br>
</font></p>

<center><font size="+1"><u>Rationale</u><br>
</font></center>

<p><font size="+1">Mandatory assemblies should be held to further
some generally goal accepted social or educational goal. The decision
concerning these goals should be made by a broader group than the
high school administration. Many teachers and students have objected
repeatedly to certain mandatory assemblies without results. They feel
that their voices have not been heard.<br>
<br>
Non-mandatory assemblies which last two or more blocks can be treated
as optional field trips.<br>
<br>
"Administration" as used in this bill is intended to include both the
high school administration and those at the central office.<br>

This process will be implemented for one semester, after which time a
committee comprised of representatives of the LHS Senate, the
principal, and the assistant principals shall meet to determine the
future and possible expansion of this program.<br>
</font></p>

<center><font size="+1"><u>Rationale</u><br>
</font></center>

<p><font size="+1">This bill provides the opportunity to test the
idea of canceling classes rather than having substitutes. It is
believed that this bill will save significant money for the Lexington
school system, and avoid the unproductive use of time that
substitutes can cause.<br>

<p><font size="+1"><b>6-90</b> <b>Substitute Evaluation Bill
(repealed: Bill 6-96)</b><br>
At least once during the school year, a substitute shall be evaluated
following a substitution day. The evaluation will consist of a report
from the classes the substitute taught in the form of a responsive
questionnaire, and a report from the absent teacher as to how well
the substitute fulfilled the teacher's plans. Upon completion, these
documents will be forwarded to the office of the principal for
review. This information shall be used as a basis for the continuing
employment of that particular substitute.<br>
<br>
The Senate recommends that permanent substitutes, or those who are
hired on a regular basis by the system, also be evaluated by an
assistant principal at least once a year.<br>
</font></p>

<center><font size="+1"><u>Rationale</u><br>
</font></center>

<p><font size="+1">The current system of reviewing substitutes calls
for a teacher who is unhappy with a substitute's performance to
report it to the main office.This system will compel students and
teachers to evaluate a substitute in a more complete fashion. It is
the hope of the Senate that this bill will improve the process for
hiring quality substitutes.<br>

The Senate resolves that the administration should more vigilantly

<center><font size="+1"><u>Rationale</u><br>
</font></center>

<p><font size="+1">The Senate has passed numerous bills that have not
been enforced by the administration, the proper agent for
enforcement. This lack of enforcement has, in all likelihood,
diminished the importance and power of the Senate in the eyes of the
school community. More importantly, the policies the Senate has
created have not been implemented.<br>

put up the posters will be responsible for their removal within one
school week after the event. Posters must be approved by the
activity's faculty advisor and/or by the student activities
coordinator. Said advisor will insure that only a reasonable amount
of posters will be hung. All possible efforts will be made to recycle
the posters.<br>

<p><font size="+1"><b>6-91</b> <b>Enforcement Resolution<br>
</b>The Student/ Faculty Senate relies upon the Lexington High School
administration to implement and enforce the policies that the Senate
passes. Although this work is usually done in good faith, the
administration has occasionally been lax in fulfilling its
responsibility. Therefore, the Senate feels compelled to direct the
administration's attention and that of the school community at large
to the following bills, some of which have never been enforced,
others of which demand renewed and constant vigilance. The Senate
asks that these policies receive the attention that they merit:<br>

<br>
</font></p>

<center><font size="+1"><u>Rationale</u><br>
</font></center>

<p><font size="+1">Senate was created to act as a voice for the
students and faculty in the school community. While it is important
for school administrator to maintain the ability to crate school
policy, the opinions of students and faculty members reflected by the
Senate should be heard before decisions are made. Because of the
existence of other policy-making bodies, the Senate is often left
out, or is left to discuss extraneous issues and not focus on
concrete proposals for policy change. This bill facilitates
communication through policy and allows for an official record of
Senate opinions on all school decisions. In addition, this bill
creates a precedent for interaction between the Senate and the School
Council concerning issues that originate form the Council.
Principal's Note The term 'policy' in this bill refers to legislative
policy, not executive procedure. It will be up to the administration
to decide whether the changes they initiate are in fact policies
which must be reviewed by the Senate or merely executive revisions.
It should also be noted that the areas with which the Senate is
constituted to be involved or has been involved by practice may serve
as a guideline for such as decision.<br>

<p><font size="+1"><b>6-97</b> <b>Extracurricular Activities
Substance Use Policy Bill </b><br>
1. Students are strictly prohibited from actions involving drugs and
alcohol during school hours or on school property or at any
school-sponsored activity or event. Such prohibited activities
include but are not limited to: a. Attempting to purchase b. Using or
have used c. Possession d. Intention or attempting to sell or
distribute e. Selling or distributing f. Possession of drug
paraphernalia.<br>
2. For purposes of this policy alcohol and drugs include not only
alcohol, controlled substances as defined in Mass. Gen. Laws, Ch.
(4C(including but not limited to marijuana, cocaine and heroin), but
also restricted drugs which are misused; steroids; and products
misused for the purposes of mind altering effects (aerosols,
solvents, etc.)<br>
3. Students who violate this policy will be subject to disciplinary
action up to and including expulsion as set fourth in Discipline -
School Guidelines.<br>
4. The school will cooperate fully with the police to deal with
violations of the law on school property.<br>
5. In addition to the rules and regulations outlined in this policy
governing all students at Lexington High School, students
participating in interscholastic sports will be responsible to the
rules and regulations of the MIAA.<br>
6. Students who are suspected of being under the influence of a
substance or in possession of a substance on school grounds will be
referred to the Asst. Principal and in some cases to the school nurse
for assessment. If the situation warrants, parents will be notified
and requested to take the student home. Provisions related to search
and seizure and student discipline will also be followed. 7. If any
of the above regulations are violated either in school or outside of
school, the student will be referred to the Student Assistance Team.
However, the school is only allowed to take disciplinary action
against students for violations on school grounds or school sponsored
activities.<br>
<br>
</font></p>

<center><font size="+1"><u>Rationale</u><br>
</font></center>

<p><font size="+1">1. Any policy that attempts to govern Lexington
High School students should only be concerned with the governing of
students on school grounds, thus the current policy is the school
overstepping its jurisdiction of students.<br>
2. It is the school's primary objective to educate students, not
punish students. This policy undermines the educational integrity of
the school in that it is not the school's responsibility to control,
enforce or attempt to provide repercussions for events that occur
outside of school or school related functions.<br>
3. The current policy has created a double jeopardy issue in that
there are both legal and academic penalties for actions in one's
personal life outside of school.<br>
4. As the current policy is now stated, it is unclear what
constitutes a violation off-campus.<br>
5. Academic and extracurricular competency have no connection with
responsibility in students personal decision making. Until the
personal decision making on the students' part, or lack thereof,
enters into the extracurricular circle there should be no penalties
of this nature [as stated in the current policy] imposed by
the school.<br>

to pass, the secretary will publish the vote count in the

It is important and useful to know what the results of a vote on a

resolution can have a better sense of the feelings of the Senate
without consulting Senate minutes. The results of the vote can also
help the principal in evaluating the feelings of the Senate when

Students assigned to regular after school detention by the high

This option will be available to students providing the following
conditions exist:<br>
</font></p>

<blockquote><font size="+1">1. The students in detention hall choose
   this option of their own free will. No student assigned detention
   shall be compelled to perform work service.<br>
   2. One of the two teachers assigned to proctor the detention hall
   volunteers to supervise said work service.<br>
   3. Weather conditions permit such service to be performed.<br>
   4. This service does not interfere with regular custodial
   tasks.<br>
   5. An outline of necessary services to be performed is provided
   either by the administration or the custodial staff to the
   teachers proctoring the detention hall.<br>
   <br>
   Students who agree to perform these tasks shall have their
   detention time reduced by one half. Therefore, a student with one
   hour of detention need perform only a half hour of work service to
   satisfy his/her detention requirement. Those with two hours may

<b>3-98 Policy Review Bill<br>
</b>I. Any proposed changes to the written policy in the
Student/Parent Handbook the fall under the scope and jurisdiction of
the Senate (see Article VI Senate Constitution) must be submitted to
the Senate review prior to becoming official written
policy.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">II. Review will be defined as one of the
following:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">A. Consideration by the Senate of the proposed
change as a bill;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">B. Consideration by the Senate of the proposed
change as a resolution.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">III. Only the administration and the School
Council may make changes to the handbook without the approval of the
Senate. However, these parties must submit such changes to the Senate
before they can become policy. Such a submission will be reviewed in
the Senate as a resolution. The Senate reserves the right to amend,
alter, or rescind such policies in the form of a bill.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">IV. The Senate, if it chooses to discuss a
proposed change as a resolution by a majority, will have only two
meetings to discuss and vote on the resolution. A proposed change
that is either ignored by the Senate or not voted on within tow
Senate meetings may become policy.</font></p>

<center><font size="+1"><b>Rationale</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">Senate was created to act as a voice for the
students and faculty in the school community. While it is important
for school administrator to maintain the ability to crate school
policy, the opinions of students and faculty members reflected by the
Senate should be heard before decisions are made. Because of the
existence of other policy-making bodies, the Senate is often left
out, or is left to discuss extraneous issues and not focus on
concrete proposals for policy change. This bill facilitates
communication through policy and allows for an official record of
Senate opinions on all school decisions. In addition, this bill
creates a precedent for interaction between the Senate and the School
Council concerning issues that originate form the Council.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><font size="+1"><b>Principal's Note</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">The term "policy" in this bill refers to
legislative policy, not executive procedure. It will be up to the
administration to decide whether the changes they initiate are in
fact policies which must be reviewed by the Senate or merely
executive revisions. It should also be noted that the areas with
which the Senate is constituted to be involved or has been involved
by practice may serve as a guideline for such as decision.</font></p>

<b>4-98 Extracurricular Activities Substance Use Policy Bill<br>
</b>1. Students are strictly prohibited from actions involving drugs
and alcohol during school hours or on school property or at any
school-sponsored activity or event. Such prohibited activities
include but are not limited to:</font></p>

<blockquote><blockquote><font size="+1">a. Attempting to purchase<br>
      b. Using or have used<br>
      c. Possession<br>
      d. Intention or attempting to sell or distribute<br>
      e. Selling or distributing<br>
      f. Possession of drug paraphernalia.<br>
      2. For purposes of this policy alcohol and drugs include not
      only alcohol, controlled substances as defined in Mass. Gen.
      Laws, Ch. (4C(including but not limited to marijuana, cocaine
      and heroin), but also restricted drugs which are misused;
      steroids; and products misused for the purposes of mind
      altering effects (aerosols, solvents, etc.) </font></blockquote>
   
   <p><font size="+1">3. Students who violate this policy will be
   subject to disciplinary action up to and including expulsion as
   set fourth in Discipline - School Guidelines.<br>
   4. The school will cooperate fully with the police to deal with
   violations of the law on school property.<br>
   5. In addition to the rules and regulations outlined in this
   policy governing all students at Lexington High School, students
   participating in interscholastic sports will be responsible to the
   rules and regulations of the MIAA.<br>
   6. Students who are suspected of being under the influence of a
   substance or in possession of a substance on school grounds will
   be referred to the Asst. Principal and in some cases to the school
   nurse for assessment. If the situation warrants, parents will be
   notified and requested to take the student home. Provisions
   related to search and seizure and student discipline will also be
   followed.<br>
   7. If any of the above regulations are violated either in school
   or outside of school, the student will be referred to the Student
   Assistance Team. However, the school is only allowed to take
   disciplinary action against students for violations on school
   grounds or school sponsored activities.</font></p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><font size="+1"><b>Rationale</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">1. Any policy that attempts to govern Lexington
High School students should only be concerned with the governing of
students on school grounds, thus the current policy is the school
overstepping its jurisdiction of students.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">2. It is the school's primary objective to educate
students, not punish students. This policy undermines the educational
integrity of the school in that it is not the school's responsibility
to control, enforce or attempt to provide repercussions for events
that occur outside of school or school related functions.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">3. The current policy has created a double
jeopardy issue in that there are both legal and academic penalties
for actions in one's personal life outside of school.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">4. As the current policy is now stated, it is
unclear what constitutes a "violation" off-campus.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">5. Academic and extracurricular competency have no
connection with responsibility in students personal decision making.
Until the personal decision making on the students' part, or lack
thereof, enters into the extracurricular circle there should be no
penalties of this nature [as stated in the current policy]
imposed by the school.</font></p>

areas for the non-deposit juice cans and for the five cent deposit

2. Provide receptacles in and around outside eating areas for

3. Gather all cans and bottles on a regular basis at a centralized

will be a hand vote and the votes will be counted. The secretary will
then publish the results of the vote by number on the copy of the
bill or resolution sent to the principal and on the final copy given
to the Senate and published in the Bills List. If a bill or
resolution fails to pass, the secretary will publish the vote count
in the minutes.</font></p>

<center><font size="+1"><b>Rationale</b></font></center>

<p><font size="+1">It is important and useful to know what the
results of a vote on a bill or resolution were by number. This way, a
reader of the bill or resolution can have a better sense of the
feelings of the Senate without consulting Senate minutes. The results
of the vote can also help the principal in evaluating the feelings of
the Senate when making a decision to approve or veto a bill or when
considering a resolution.</font></p>

<b>7-98 Work Service Detention Bill<br>
</b>Students assigned to regular after school detention by the high
school administration may choose to use their detention time to
perform work service in cleaning up the school instead of sitting in
the detention hall. This option will be available to students
providing the following conditions exist:<br>
1. The students in detention hall choose this option of their own
free will. No student assigned detention shall be compelled to
perform work service.<br>
2. One of the two teachers assigned to proctor the detention hall
volunteers to supervise said work service.<br>
3. Weather conditions permit such service to be performed.<br>
4. This service does not interfere with regular custodial tasks.<br>
5. An outline of necessary services to be performed is provided
either by the administration or the custodial staff to the teachers
proctoring the detention hall. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Students who agree to perform these tasks shall
have their detention time reduced by one half. Therefore, a student
with one hour of detention need perform only a half hour of work
service to satisfy his/her detention requirement. Those with two
hours may perform up to one hour of work service, though no student
with one hour of detention need perform only a half hour of work
service to satisfy his/her detention requirement. Those with two

may perform more the one hour of work service on a given day. Any

<p><font size="+1"><b>1-99 Lexington High School Honor Code
</b></font></p>

<p><font size="+1">A core value of an institution that seeks to
maintain high moral and ethical standards is the intolerance of
cheating in any form. Cheating undermines both the integrity of the
perpetrator as well as that of the school. In presenting a code of
conduct based on individual integrity and ethics, we aim to create a
vision of what we would like our community to be. The Honor Code
intends to reduce the level of unhealthy competition in the school by
shifting peer pressure away from cheating and toward ethical
behavior.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">1. The following will be considered
cheating*:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">a. The willful giving or receiving of an
unauthorized, dishonest, or unscrupulous advantage in academic
work.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">b. The above may be accomplished by any means
whatsoever, including, but not limited to, the following: fraud,
duress, deception, theft, talking, signs, gestures, copying from
another student, unauthorized collaboration, and the unauthorized use
of study aids, memoranda, books, electronic programs, data or other
information. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">c. Attempted Cheating.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">2. The following will be considered
plagiarism*:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">a. Presenting as one's own the words, the work, or
the opinions of someone else without prior acknowledgement.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">b. Borrowing the sequence of ideas, the
arrangement of material, or the pattern of thought of someone else
without proper acknowledgement.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">3. If a student cheats or plagiarizes, she or he
may receive zero for the entire assignment and may not qualify for
make up of the assignment subject to the teacher's discretion. The
School reserves the right to assign additional penalties based on the
severity of the offense up to and including suspension or
expulsion.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">4. In order to prevent misunderstandings, at the
beginning of each course the teacher will clarify what constitutes a
violation of the Honor Code in his/her class. This should include an

<p><font size="+1"><b>Report Card Bill (Passed January 26,
2001)</b></font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The printing of report cards shall not contain
information regarding the distribution of grades within the classes
taken by the student. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Rationale</b></font></p>

<p><font size="+1">a. The current system promotes competition between
students and fosters a climate of stress.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Students spend enough time and energy trying to
figure out where they rank amongst their peers, and stress over the
competitive aspects of school and grades enough. We have already
abolished class rank; this proposal would be analogous to that with
regards to individual classes. Many students have confused
achievement with self-esteem. The grades should be taken as they are,
as fitting in with the student handbook definition of grades, and not
as comparison with other students.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">b. The current system helps to create and
perpetuate reputations of teachers. Teachers' grading patterns are
revealed, which has resulted in the creation of reputations. While
granting that these tendencies would eventually become general
knowledge anyhow, this provides a sense of factual backing for those
assumptions. As such, based on these reputations, students try to get
in or out of certain courses based on the relative ease or lack
thereof of obtaining a high grade. This creates problems for
teachers, students and guidance counselors. Teachers may be doing
excellent work in challenging, inspiring, and educating students, but
those students who focus on the grade focus on the results rather
than the means. Nor are these reputations necessarily
correct.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">c. The current system leads to incorrect analysis.
Each class is a unique entity with its own personality. Regarding the
many classes at certain levels, it must be noted that some classes
are stronger as a whole than others. For example, a Level I class
taught by one teacher may have many A and B grades and no C/D/F
grades due to the caliber of students placed into it, while another
Level 1 class taught by the same teacher has a high number of B and C
grades, with few A or D or F grades. Assignments, tests, essay
assignments and the like may all be the same, as is the grading
criteria.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">d. The current system creates tensions between
teachers. Upon being appraised of the grade breakdowns, teachers who
are statistically revealed as being "easy graders'" or "hard graders"
find themselves at odds with the rest of the teachers in the subject.
The simple fact is that there is no standardized grading system, and
that each teacher has his or her own requirements and criteria and
system for grading. Teachers who give too many high grades may feel
pressure from peers to tighten up on their criteria, while those who
give few high grades may feel pressure from peers (as well as
parents) to be more generous. When one teacher is more stringent or
lenient than the rest of the peers, resentment may ensue. (Teachers
are people too.)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">e. The current system is incompatible with what is
written in the Student Handbook. From page 96 of the LHS Handbook
2000-2001: </font></p>

<blockquote><font size="+1">"We believe that grades should serve
   several goals:<br>
   1. They should record and communicate achievement within an
   instructional level.<br>
   2. They should serve as an incentive for students to work and
   achieve to their level of ability.<br>
   3. They should differentiate among students on some clearly
   established and educationally meaningful basis."</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="+1">Clearly the first two items do not lend support to
the current system. However, the last one conceivably could be
interpreted as doing so. But all that statement does is point out
that there is in fact a system of defining what each grade actually
means, and in fact the bottom of page 96 and the top of page 97 lay
out what the letter grades, as well as "P" and "I", stand
for.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Teachers are required to tell students of their
grading policies. Teachers are not, however, required to tell
students of how many people fit the varying
differentiations.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">We, the Lexington High School Student-Faculty

perpetrated upon the Lexington High School community and specifically
upon the privacy of our principal, Dr. Van Seasholes. We understand
that there has been a long tradition of senior practical jokes each
spring before graduation, but we find this year's actions to be
extremely mean spirited. We are particularly upset at those which
were directed against Dr. Seasholes seemingly as a result of his
taking the necessary disciplinary action to punish the perpetrators
of the pranks at the high school. Although the actions of a few
should not reflect upon the upstanding behavior of most students at
LHS, we believe that the recent pranks cross a serious line and
ultimately reflect badly upon the student body as a whole at
Lexington High School. Therefore, this resolution is intended to
publicly condemn the actions of those students involved.</font></p>

to the Minuteman regarding the override</b></font></p>

<p><font size="+1">6/11/03</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">At our June 12, 2003 meeting, we, the Lexington
High School Student-Faculty Senate, passed the following resolution
in response to voters recent rejection of the tax
override.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">LHS will be impacted directly by the vote against
the override in many ways. Presently, one projected budget cut is the
equivalent of three existing teaching positions. Some classes,
especially in the foreign language and social studies departments,
are already filled to capacity. Losing teachers on top of being
unable to hire new ones to meet enrollment increases will greatly
affect teachers workloads and students classroom
experiences. Among other cutbacks, LHS will lose a dean, a secretary,
and a custodian next year. The physical education and art departments
are particularly susceptible to cutbacks, and are likely to lose
faculty positions.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Needless to say, the general opinion of the Senate
on the vote is negative. We recognize that a tax increase during hard
economic times is less than appealing to most voters, but the high
quality of its public schools makes Lexington the valued community
that it is. The students among us are deeply appreciative of the
programs, teachers, administrators, and faculty that make our
experience at LHS a valuable one. We regret our towns
decision to reduce its support for our school and its faculty.

Bill</b></font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Commencing with the next scheduled Senate meeting,
each committee chair (or designee) will formally report the
attendance at the previous committee meeting. These reports of
committee attendance will be communicated to the Secretary and placed
in the official minutes of the Senate.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Rationale: Attendance at committee meetings is
important and necessary in order for the Senate to properly attend to
its responsibilities. Official, public reporting of a
Senators attendance at both Senate and committee meetings
provides the electorate the opportunity to have this information.
This approach to committee attendance is public, straightforward,
easy to administer, and not punitive.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><a name="2-03"></a><b>2-03</b> <b>Honor Code
Reporting And Awareness Bill</b></font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Teachers, in consultation with their department
heads, will report substantial breaches of the Lexington High School
(LHS) Honor Code for which a student incurs academic or disciplinary
consequences to the student's dean and counselor. Each incident will
be recorded and held in strict confidence by the dean and counselor
except when necessary to report to the Board of Appeals.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The accumulation of more than one breach will be
interpreted as a pattern of intellectual dishonesty and will result
in an automatic one day suspension. Students have the right to appeal
this ruling via the Board of Appeals as per the LHS constitution. The
Board will determine if the student's record constitutes a pattern of
intellectual dishonesty, where a pattern is defined as multiple
breaches of the LHS Honor Code. In making its determination the Board
will require input from both the reporting teacher(s) and accused
student. If the board finds that there is such a pattern, it must
recommend disciplinary action. The board will weigh heavily the
character of the breaches when deciding what disciplinary action(s)
to recommend.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This bill places no limits on the current LHS
Honor Code, which allows for individual breaches of the code to be
met with the full range of disciplinary consequences, up to and
including expulsion.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">At the beginning of each school year, in homeroom,
every student will be furnished with a printed copy of the LHS Honor
code and this bill. Students will be provided adequate time in a
supervised environment to read the code and the terms of the
reporting bill and ask questions about them. Then each student will
be required to sign a form which indicates that he or she has read
the code and understands the terms of it and the potential penalties
as well a his or her rights of appeal if accused of a violation. This
form will not be construed as an acknowledgment by each student that
he or she will abide by the code, though it is the school's hope that
they will. It will only be a formal certification that they
understand the code and the consequences of violating it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>Rationale</b></font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Anecdotal evidence suggests that clear breaches of
the LHS Honor Code are not incurring official disciplinary action.
Additionally, student breaches of the honor code appear to occur with
an unsettling frequency.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This bill provides for the collection of
quantifiable data on student behavior and allows students with a
pattern of intellectual dishonesty to be identified and appropriate
action to be taken. Currently, many infractions of thehonor code are
handled informally, by providing a zero on the assignment, etc.. this
now means that no record of the infraction be taken. Currently, many
infractions of the honor code are handled informally, by providing a
zero on the assignment, etc. This now means that no record of the
infraction exists. Without such a record it is conceivable that one
could incur multiple infractions across classes and grade
levels.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Acts of intellectual dishonesty adversely affect
the entirely of the Lexington community. Therefore, the consequences
for such behavior should be appropriately stern.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Although LHS has had an honor code on record for a
number of years which is printed in the Student handbook each year,
few students really know of its existence, understand the terms of it
or have had an opportunity to ask questions about it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Passage of this bill may result in serious
consequences for violating the honor code. Therefore, students should
have clear understanding of what is in the code and should formally
acknowledge that they have read it and understand what may occur if
they violate it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">No honor code can be effective unless that
organization which adopts it (in this case the LHS Student Faculty
Senate) does everything in its power to inform its constituency of
the code's existence and the potential consequences for violating
it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Using the Board of Appeals as the mediating agent
in any dispute over a potential honor code violation will serve to
give that agency some long overdue power and
responsibility.</font></p>

<br>
<br>
Voting records of senators on bills and resolutions are to be placed in
the official minutes of the senate, as well as made available from all
years of the senators&#8217; tenure at election time each year.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The secretary will be responsible for keeping voting records while in
this role, as well as passing on all voting records in his or her
possession to the next year&#8217;s elected secretary so that the voting
records (over the entire tenure) of a senator can be made available at
election time.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Records of votes to call the question, approve the agenda/minutes, and other such matters are not required to be kept.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Rationale:</span><br>
<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill seeks to focus the attention of voters
on the issues at hand, and give voters an idea of the views of senators
elected in previous years.&nbsp; As very few non-senators attend senate
meetings, it provides students information they otherwise would not
have known, and helps ensure that the senators elected each year are
representative of students&#8217; views, and not elected solely based on
popularity.<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing the text of senate bills, as well as
records of how each senator voted on all bills during his or her
tenure, may lead to increased non-senator participation in the senate,
increased dialogue between the student body at large and the senators
elected from each class, and heightened awareness of the existence and
purpose of the senate.<br>
<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Records are only required to be kept of votes on
resolutions and bills as these are the most important actions the
senate takes, and are typically more controversial and have a greater
affect on LHS than do the more minor votes mentioned in paragraph three
of the bill.<br>
<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While this method of recording who votes for and
against which bills and resolutions may increase slightly the time it
takes to count the votes, it is worth doing in order to have a more
informed student and faculty body and elections that are more
issue-based.</font></p>

<b><a name="2007-1">2007-1 Poster Bill</a></b>
		<br>Passed on October 24, 2007

<br>Students and faculty may place posters for school or club related
events and meetings on interior walls and on the end sections of
lockers throughout the LHS campus. Such notices are to be hung with
masking tape only. Posters may not be placed on glass, in stairwells,
or on, or within five feet of, any egress door (all classroom exits,
doors to halls, stairwells and the outside). Posters must be approved
and initialed by the activity's faculty advisor or a dean, who will
ensure that not more than fifty posters will be hung. All posters must
have a date of removal on them unless they refer to a specific event,
and posterers are expected to remove posters immediately after the
event or on the specified date. All possible efforts will be made to
recycle the posters.
<br>It is the Climate Committee's responsibility to identify and
maintain an area or areas, approved by the Administration, including
the current free postering area in Commons I, for posters not related
to school activities. Posters may be placed in this area by students,
faculty and staff, and need no faculty or dean's signature or removal
date. It is expected that the community will show good judgment in
selecting the quantity and size of posters placed in this area so that
all messages can be accommodated.
<br>In addition, the Climate Committee will promote good poster
behavior throughout the school and communicate when possible with
violators of this bill.
<br><br>Rationale
<br>1. This bill modifies the 2004 Bill Billboard Bill in three ways.  

<br>a. It specifies a maximum number of posters allowed in the halls
and commons areas. There are twelve main halls in the school and two
commons areas. Three or four posters per hall and in each of the
commons areas are sufficient to guarantee that all students will see a
poster often. Within this limit students may choose to spread their
allotment of posters in a non-uniform manner. Generally fewer posters
will be sufficient.
<br>b.  It restricts placement of posters in conformance with fire code.

<br>c. It directs the Climate Committee take leadership in maintaining
the provisions of this bill throughout the school, not just in the free
postering areas.
<br>2. The 2004 Bill Billboard Bill was never inserted into the
Student Handbook, although it was written by the Climate Committee in
consultation with the principal and, in accordance with the Senate
Constitution, approved by him as school policy. In spite of this
oversight the current administration operates with the understanding
that the Bill Billboard Bill is current school policy.
<br>3. The 2004 Bill Billboard Bill and this improved bill include
certain student rights which the former policy does not, and these
rights should be made manifest each year. We update here the rationale
of the 2004 bill:
"Postering is an important right of free speech which benefits the LHS
community. This bill is intended to preserve that right to the greatest
extent possible. It is expected that posters may be provocative and
even offensive to some, but that no personal attacks or hate speech
will be tolerated."

 <b><a name="2008-1">2008-1 Transcript Bill</a></b>

<br>On student transcripts the number of hours of community service
completed will no longer be recorded. Instead transcripts will read
"Community Service graduation requirement completed: yes/no" indicating
whether the student has completed the required hours of community
service.
<br><br>Rationale

<br>1. The community service requirement states a minimum number of
hours of service. The school has no basis for evaluating whether more
hours represent better or more socially useful service. Students should
not be encouraged to add more and more hours to their transcripts
simply because the transcript records these hours.
<br>2. Students who perform the minimal number of hours should not be
made to look inferior to those who have performed more than the minimum
hours, yet admission officers may draw this conclusion in comparing
students from this high school.
<br>3.  Students who feel that their service is extraordinary can tell this to admissions officers in their application process.

<br>To allow for more access to fundraising opportunities, the Arts and

activities (i.e. bake sales, etc) as follows:
<br>I. Student organizations will comply with the fundraising policy
in the Student/Parent handbook and the District Activities Manual:
<br>"All fund-raising activities...involving students, individual
classes or school-connected organizations, for whatever purpose, must
be discussed fully with a Dean and advisor of the organizations before
they begin."
<br>II. All other student organizations may schedule no more than one
after-school fundraiser per week and will submit requests for
fundraiser spots at least one week in advance and no more than four
weeks in advance.
<br>III.	To promote accessibility, student organizations that have scheduled fewer prior fundraisers that year will have priority. 

<br><br><u>Rationale:</u>
 
<br>As reported in the Social Action Committee's Fundraising
Opportunity Report for 2009-2010, a small handful of clubs account for
a majority of the fundraisers. Currently, it is difficult for some
groups to schedule fundraisers mid-way through the school year due to
certain groups scheduling fundraisers months in advance.
<br>This bill intends to formalize the process of scheduling fundraisers in the arts and humanities hallway.

Let it be resolved that when new bills and documents are to be presented before the Senate, they will:<br>
-Be distributed in print to all Senators at the Senate meeting at least one week before they are intended to be discussed.<br>-Even
after the bill is distributed, the author retains the right to amend
the bill as necessary prior to formal discussion of the bill.<br>
-Bill authors will be able to explain the bill and its rationale briefly during open comments on the date of distribution.<br>
-Have the author's e-mail address (or some form of contact information) documented at the bottom of the bill draft.<br>
-Be submitted to the Policy Committee for consideration the Monday of
the week before the date of distribution of copies of the bill to the
Senate.<br>


<br><u>Rationale:</u><br> -The current system of having bills and
documents distributed to Senators through the FirstClass system has
proven to be an ineffective means of allowing Senators to ponder topics
before the actual Senate meeting.<br>
-Having a week to consider a discussion item on one's own time or with
committees before it is to be officially discussed in a Senate meeting
is a vital part of the discussion process, as forethought allows for
Senators to develop discussion points to make meetings more efficient
and effective.<br>
-The author's e-mail address on documents will allow Senators to contact each other outside of meetings.<br>
-Lastly, the Policy Committee's primary function of bill review has
been previously neglected, and should be practiced. Providing a copy of

no later than the quarter following the rejection of the service, with
paperwork approved for the type and hours of service.<br>
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;The student, in discussion with the Board, reflects on the service performed and its meaning to the student.<br>
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;The Board votes to grant the credit, based on the satisfactory completion of 1. and 2.<br><br>
In order to facilitate a transition to a consistently enforced school
policy, all students have until the end of Quarter 1, 2011-2012 to
submit to the Community Service secretary paperwork for service
performed at any prior time during their high school career, and this
service will not be rejected for lateness.<br><br>
It is suggested that the Board of Appeals meet on the same day as
Attendance appeals for the convenience of scheduling and announcements.
The Board of Appeals will establish any procedures necessary to carry
out this new task.<br><br>
The Community Service secretary shall keep a record of student hours
rejected for late filing and each student's homeroom teacher and
guidance counselor shall be informed of these hours.<br><br> 

The Student Handbook should be updated to describe the relevant provisions of this bill.<br><br>
The Senate will provide quarterly reminders through homeroom
announcements to students to fulfill their Community Service and file
their paperwork in a timely fashion.<br><br>

The Senate will evaluate the success of this new policy in one year.<br><br> 

<u>Rationale</u><br>
1.&nbsp;The Senate commends the administration and counselors for
working with upper class students in danger of failing to complete
their community service, and commends the Community Service Secretary
for posting periodic reminders of deadlines in homeroom announcements.<br><br>
Nevertheless, this is insufficient support for students. The community
service requirement and firm deadlines for filing forms are justified
only if the faculty supports students in their efforts. This support
must be ongoing so that students perform their service in a meaningful
and reflective way and report their service in a timely fashion.<br><br>
The Senate created the Community Service requirement and the faculty
voted to continue it when it created the current school Mission
Statement. The Senate cannot command the faculty to support students
but it is the intent of this bill to suggest that it has a moral
obligation to provide the same level of support that is given to
students who have long term assignments in academic courses, namely
with:<br>	
&nbsp;A requirement for students to have a plan for achieving their goals.<br>
&nbsp;Periodic check-ins.<br>
&nbsp;Recognition of ongoing success.<br><br>
This obligation falls naturally upon homeroom teachers and counselors
and time for them to carry out their work should be provided by the
administration, perhaps with extended homeroom periods.<br><br>

2.&nbsp;From the recommendations of the Community Service Report of 2006:<br>
"..., the committee believes the program cannot be successful without
the voluntary commitment of faculty and students. Specifically, faculty
and students must seek out students who are disengaged from this
process, and encourage timely group participation in service to the
community."<br><br>

3.&nbsp;<a href="#4-88">Senate Bill 4-88</a>
specifies certain procedures for the Board of Appeals to follow which
may need to be modified to hear Community Service appeals. The Board is
hereby authorized to exercise its judgment in making these
modifications.<br><br>

4.  The Social and Civic Expectations of the LHS Mission Statement.<br>
Students at Lexington High School will . . .
<ul><li>learn to make appropriate and healthy choices that foster their
personal well being, and will seek support when needed for academic,
social, physical, mental, and emotional issues.</li>
<li>demonstrate self-awareness, tolerance, and respect while
cultivating social skills that reflect self-assurance, kindness, and
tact.</li>
<li>act with integrity and be accountable to themselves, to the school, and to the community at large.</li>
<li>participate in meaningful community service activities that expand their life experience and benefit others.</li>
<li>act as responsible citizens, recognizing the important stake they
have in the school community while finding constructive opportunities
to influence its direction.</li></ul>

<br><b><font size="+1">2011-3 Substitute Teacher Testing Resolution</font></b>
 
<br><br>Recognizing the constitutional restriction forbidding the
Student/Faculty Senate from legislating how teachers organize their
courses and evaluate their students, but observing the need for all
students to have equal and fair opportunities for evaluation,
<br><br><u>The Student/Faculty Senate hereby resolves that faculty
members should not give major exams or tests on days when they are
absent and the class is being taught by a substitute teacher.</u>

<br><br><u>Rationale:</u>
<br><ol>
<li>When teachers choose to postpone tests, they often begin teaching
curriculum that will be included in the next assessment, aware that
students need to continue working even if their evaluation is delayed.
If a substitute teacher is present, the teacher could leave alternative
work for the students, with the assumption that they will check the
work upon their return and/or that the students will be responsible for
that material on the next unit's assessment.</li>

<li>When substitute teachers are responsible for giving tests, they are
often not aware of special testing accommodations given to individual
students, and are less able to make decisions regarding a student's
need to take the assessment on a different day or receive other
accommodations (e.g. typing an essay instead of handwriting it).</li>

<li>Substitute teachers are unable to answer students' inquiries
regarding confusing test questions covering material the student
comprehends. Substitutes therefore cannot give the clarification that a
teacher might provide, and so the student might not receive credit for
material they understand.</li>

<li>Cheating is more likely to occur when a teacher is not present to
supervise as a class takes a test. The presence of a teacher during
administration of an assessment greatly discourages violations of the
LHS Honor Code.</li>
<li>The Student/Faculty Senate's <a href="#1094">Junior-Senior Substitute Bill (10-94)</a>
allows for teachers to cancel classes composed solely of upperclassmen
in the event of the teacher's absence, provided they feel students
could use the time productively and the teacher leaves an assignment
for the students. While teachers may sometimes feel it is not
advantageous to cancel class, this option provides teachers with an
additional alternative to giving a major assessment in a class taught
by a substitute.</li>

<a style="font-weight: bold;" name="2012-1_homeeroom_visit_bill"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"> 2012-1&nbsp; Homeroom Visit Bill</span></big><br>
<br>
Following elections, every student Senator will be assigned 2-3
homerooms of the same graduation year, including their own
homeroom.&nbsp; After the Senate calls a homeroom visit Senators will
be expected to visit each of their assigned homerooms over the course
of the next three homeroom periods.<br>
<br>
The following will be placed at the end of homeroom announcements
beginning on the Thursday after the Senate calls a homeroom
visit.&nbsp; This announcement will run for the following three
homeroom periods:<br>
<br>
"Student Senators will be visiting homerooms for the next two
weeks.&nbsp; Expect a Senator from your graduation year to come into
our homeroom to present Senate-related information and solicit
feedback."<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Calling a homeroom visit</span><br>
A committee may call a homeroom visit when specific feedback or
information is required from the general student population.&nbsp; A
homeroom visit may also be called to notify students after a bill or
resolution has been passed or as need arises.<br>
<br>
The committee that calls the visit must write a set of guidelines that
will be distributed to all Senators before the visits begin.&nbsp;
These guidelines will structure discussion and ensure uniformity in
information related by Senators and in type of student response.&nbsp;
Senators are encouraged to take notes based on these guidelines or
otherwise record information received in their assigned
homerooms.&nbsp; Guidelines must be submitted to either the Policy or
Executive committee for approval prior to distribution.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Discussion of homeroom visits</span><br>
Homeroom visit discussion must be inserted into the agenda of the first
Senate meeting after homeroom visits have been completed.&nbsp; This
discussion will be limited to fifteen minutes but may be extended upon
a suspension of the rules.&nbsp; One the discussion is completed,
Senators are expected to submit any notes taken in their assigned
homerooms to the chair of the committee that called the visit.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rationale</span>:<br>
Student Senators represent their entire class, so they should be
required to meet with a constituent group of classmates at certain
times.&nbsp; This will spread awareness of Senate's actions while
providing the Senate with useful information about student opinions.<br>
<br>
Having specific guidelines will make Senators more comfortable speaking
to homerooms and will ensure that collected information is relevant to
issues at hand. Taking notes makes it easier to present this
information to the Senate.&nbsp; Approval by the Policy or Executive
Committee makes certain that the guidelines are sufficiently specific
and pertinent.<br>
<br>
Including time to discuss homeroom visits during Senate meeting allows
information to be related and effectively used.&nbsp; Limiting
discussion prevents an excess of repetitive or irrelevant
information.&nbsp; Giving any notes to the correct committee chair
ensure that all information recoded by Senators, whether or not it was
discussed by the Senate as a whole, is received by those who requested
it.<br>
<br>
Announcements in homerooms alert students and teachers to the visits
before hand.&nbsp; This will reduce Senator disruption of homeroom
periods and will encourage Senators to visit homerooms on the assigned
dates.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="2012-2_extended_homeroom"></a><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">2012-2 Extended Homeroom Bill</span></big><br>
<br>
If an extended homeroom takes place on Tuesday, there will be an
announcement in the homeroom meeting on the Thursday before the
extended homeroom alerting students that an extended homeroom will take
place.&nbsp; If an extended homeroom takes place on Thursday, there
will be an announcement in the homeroom meting on the Tuesday before
the extended homeroom alerting students that an extended homeroom will
take place.<br>
<br style="text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rationale:</span><br>
1.&nbsp; When an extended homeroom takes place during the day, the
first couple of blocks lose time and only last fifty minutes instead of
fifty-five.&nbsp; Students who have first block free on an extended
homeroom day have it shortened as well, but usually do not know that
their free block ends five minutes earlier.&nbsp; As a result, they
arrive to their next scheduled class five minutes late (assuming they
plan on coming to school after their free block ends).<br>
2.&nbsp; Even though extended homerooms are announced on the school
website, only a few people regularly check the website.&nbsp; An
announcement in homeroom spreads the news more efficiently.<br>

2.&nbsp; Beginning in the 2012-2013 school year, the Student Faculty
Senate Social Action Committee shall undertake a voter registration
drive lasting no less than five full school days and starting between
the second-to-last Monday in January and the first Monday in

forms are delivered to the town clerk no later than the Massachusetts

<p><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="2013-1_technology_board_bill"></a>2013-1 Technology Board Bill</span></big><br>
<br>
The Student-Faculty Senate hereby establishes a Technology Board to
advise the administration on matters pertaining to technology in the
school and to facilitate communication between members of the
administration, central office, faculty, and student body. The
composition of the Technology Board will be as follows:<br>
<br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>Eight students, two from each grade, elected by ballot during the regular spring and fall elections<br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>Seven faculty members, selected in accordance with a process to be determined by their respective Department heads<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One from the science department<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; One from the mathematics department<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; One from the world language department<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One from the English department<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; One from the history department<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One from the combined fine/performing arts departments<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; One additional representative from
PE/wellness department, special education department, or any other
department not listed above.<br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>One representative from the library department<br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>One administrator liaison<br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>One Student Senator to serve as a representative of the Senate<br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>One Instructional Technology Specialist<br>
<br>
The Director of Education Technology and Assessment will also be
informed of and invited to all meetings, and will receive copy of all
meeting notes. The Director is encouraged to attend no fewer than two
meetings per year.<br>
<br>
After elections, the Technology Board will choose one student moderator
and one faculty assistant moderator, and will write a list of
guidelines outlining matters which it would like to address in the
coming school year. These guidelines, including a provision for regular
meeting times at least once a month, will be approved by the
administration before the end of the school year in which upperclassmen
representatives are elected. The mission statement for the Technology
Board will be as follows:<br>
<br>
The Technology Board will discuss matters relating to technology use at
Lexington High School. It will take into account the interests and the
experiences of students and faculty, as well as the need to adapt to
changing technology in accordance with the Lexington School Committee&#8217;s
standards for acceptable use of technology in the Lexington Public
Schools. As members of the Technology Board, students and teachers will
have an opportunity to openly discuss technology-related matters that
impact all members of the school community. The Technology Board will
also conduct periodic surveys of student opinion, and will present its
recommendations to the administration in the form of written notes or
documents. <br>
</p>
<p><br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rationale </span><br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>Since
technology impacts all members of the school community, it is
advantageous to foster a dialogue between students, faculty, and the
administration regarding technology at LHS.<br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>The
LHS Student-Faculty Senate does not always have the time to deal with
matters relating to technology at LHS. A body dedicated solely to
technology-related matters would be better equipped to deal with these
concerns and advise the Senate on matters pertaining to technology when
necessary.<br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>Students
are frequent users of technology at the school, and therefore should
have a direct voice in technology-related decisions at LHS.<br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>Although
provisions for teachers to voice opinions surrounding technology exist,
there is currently no way for teachers and students to collaboratively
discuss matters relating to technology in the school. <br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>Current
channels of communication between the faculty and administration (such
as through department heads or PAC representatives) encourage general
discussion, but do not focus specifically on technology-related matters.<br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>Since
so many constituents of the school use technology, it is impossible to
include a representative for every group in the school. Thus one open
seat is provided in order to ensure that all relevant groups are given
an opportunity to participate.<br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>The
Student-Faculty Senator liaison will present technology-related matters
raised in Senate to the Technology Board and&nbsp; relate relevant
information back to the Senate.<br>
<small><small><small>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></small></small>The
student moderator will organize meetings, ensure that proper notes are
taken, and will encourage students and faculty to openly voice their
opinions.</p>

<br>
Lexington is an increasingly multicultural diverse community.&nbsp; LHS
should respect the diversity of religious and cultural traditions of
all students.<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp; The administration should provide to faculty and the community
at large a comprehensive list of major holiday observed by the world's
religions and/or cultures.<br>
2.&nbsp; Teachers should accommodate students on any major religious or cultural holiday.<br>
3.&nbsp; Students are strongly advised to tell teachers in advance of
upcoming religious or cultural observances, including any not mentioned
on the list, to get work in advance, reschedule assessments, etc.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rationale:</span><br>
LHS students observe many cultural and religious traditions that should
be respected by the entire community.&nbsp; While it is impossible for
the school to close for every observance students and teachers should
be respectful of holidays. Many schools, both high schools and
universities, provide a list to faculty of major holidays<br>

following locations for new benches on the LHS campus based on input of
the student body:<br>
<br>
Side:<br>
One bench in the bike rack area by the music wing/student parking lot.<br>
One bench in the grassy area near the loading dock by Commons II.<br>
<br>
Front:<br>
One additional bench by the link between the Field House and Main Building.<br>
Two benches near the front entrance overhang.<br>
<br>
Back:<br>
One bench under the central tree.<br>
One bench in the middle island near the pickup area.<br>
One bench opposite the existing math Building benches, near the Foreign Language Building.<br>
One bench in the grassy area past the Foreign Language building, with the trash can from the opposite corner moved to this area.<br>

<a name="2015-1_Revised_Senate_Attendance_Bill"></a><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">2015-1 Revised Senate Attendance Bill</span></big><br>
<br>
1)&nbsp; This bill replaces the 2014-2015 Temporary Attendance Bill and
the 2014-2015 Attendance Bill.&nbsp; The twenty percent attendance
policy outlined in Article IX of the Constitution Subpoint A will
remain in effect.<br>
<br>
2)&nbsp; Throughout this bill "Senator" shall only refer to student Senators, not faculty members.<br>
<br>
3)&nbsp; During the 2015-2016 Senate Session, Senate meetings will
officially begin at 2:35 PM and adjourn at 3:30 PM on Wednesdays,
unless specified otherwise by the Executive Committee.&nbsp; Senators
are generally expected to attend every meeting and remain present until
the meeting is adjourned.<br>
<br>
4)&nbsp; Attendance Records.<br>
a)&nbsp; The Secretary shall be responsible for keeping accurate public attendance records for all student Senators.<br>
b)&nbsp; Senators who are not present at all for the meeting shall be marked absent.<br>
c)&nbsp; If a Senator's attendance at a particular meeting is
incomplete (e.g. late arrival or early departure), it is at the
Secretary's discretion to mark it as an excused absence or as a full
absence.<br>
d)&nbsp; Excused absences are absences due to activities known in
advance that cannot be rescheduled, such as doctor's appointments,
competitive events, auditions and assessments.&nbsp; Excusal shall be
determined at the discretion of the Secretary.&nbsp; In the event of a
known absence, Senators must contact the Secretary at least 24 hours in
advance of that meeting of the Senate.&nbsp; Failure to do so shall
result in an unexcused absence.&nbsp; Both full and partial absences
may be either excused or unexcused.<br>
e)&nbsp; In the event of a health issue, family matter or other
emergency, the Secretary or the faculty member of the Executive
Committee may at his or her own discretion decide to mark an absence as
a "no-count", which will not be counted toward the attendance cap. This
allows for special circumstances but ensures that accurate attendance
records are still kept.<br>
<br>
5)&nbsp; Attendance notes.<br>
a)&nbsp; Senators are expected to keep track of heir own absences in
the pubic attendance record, but the Secretary shall issue warnings to
Senators who are at risk of being expelled from Senate.<br>
b)&nbsp; Each Senator shall be permitted four excused absences for each
year-long Senate session.&nbsp; The Secretary shall issue an attendance
warning to the Senator in question once he or she has reached two
excused absences, and again once he or she has reached four excused
absences.<br>
c)&nbsp; Each Senator shall be permitted one unexcused absence for each
year-long Senate session.&nbsp; The Secretary shall issue an attendance
warning to the Senator in question once he or she has reached one
unexcused absence.<br>
<br>
6)&nbsp; Attendance notices, appeals and decisions proceed as outlined in Article IX of he Student-Faculty Senate Constitution.<br>
<br>
7)&nbsp; This bill shall go into effect as soon as it is passed and no
attendance record from before the passing of the bill shall be taken
into account for the purpose of attendance enforcement.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rationale:</span><br>
The points in the bill only apply to student Senators because faculty
senators have professional commitments that prevent them from attending
Senate meetings.<br>
<br>
Being a Senator is a privilege, and attendance has been a growing
problem.&nbsp; Good attendance is necessary for the Senate to function
properly as per the rules of quorum.&nbsp; This policy is a decisive
measure against irresponsible attendance in the Senate.&nbsp; Failure
to abide by this policy must be seen as an inability to serve and will
rightly result in expulsion form the Senate.&nbsp; Although other
commitments exist and may conflict, consistently and effectively
representing one's peers should be of great importance to people who
have chosen to run for a responsible position in school
government.&nbsp; It is therefore necessary to create a policy that
takes into account the possibility of excusal when evaluating Senator
attendance.<br>
