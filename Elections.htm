<span style="font-weight: bold;">Information on Student Elections (</span>updated 9/14)<br>
<br>
Most offices are voted on in the spring.&nbsp; Freshmen positions are
voted on in the fall.&nbsp; Students must complete nomination papers to
become a candidate for any elected student office. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Nomination Procedure</span><br>
1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pick up nomination papers at the designated location.<br>
2)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Obtain the requisite number of signatures (50) from your classmates.<br>
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Submit the papers by the due date.<br>
4)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The earlier you turn in your nomination papers, the higher on the ballot your name will appear.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Campaign Statements</span><br>
Candidates for all offices except Class Council must post a campaign
statement saying why you are running for office on the designated
bulletin board in Commons I.&nbsp; This must be on a single 8½&#8221; x 11&#8221;
sheet of paper.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Running for Multiple Offices</span><br>
You may run for more than one office.&nbsp; However, you must submit
separate nomination papers for each office, with the exception of the
combination of Class Office/Class Council.&nbsp; You may not hold more
than one office.&nbsp; If you are elected to multiple positions, you
must resign all but one.&nbsp; This allows for greater participation
and diversity of officeholders.<br>
Publicity and Posters<br>
All campaign signs and posters must be initialed by a faculty Senate
member.&nbsp; Please get the original signed before making
copies!&nbsp; Campaign posters may not be hung before the designated
date.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Campaign Ethics</span><br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Total campaign expenditures may not exceed $25.00,
including, but not limited to, printing expenses for campaign posters
and items to give away to potential voters.&nbsp; The actual retail
value of any items provided to the candidate for free or at a
significant discount will also count toward the $25.00 cap.<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In accordance with school rules, candidates may not
distribute food items, including candy, to potential voters.<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Candidates are permitted to distribute small items
to potential voters, so long as the following conditions are met:<br>
o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The spending and food restrictions are followed.<br>
o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The items are evenly distributed without any
understanding that accepting the item constitutes an obligation to vote
for that candidate.<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All candidates will be required to sign on their
nomination form that they are aware of and agree to abide by these
rules.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Voting</span><br>
Voting takes place in homerooms. You must have a No. 2 pencil to vote as we use Scantron ballots.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Elected Positions<br>

(the number of senators varies with the total school enrollment each
year according to the rules in the LHS Senate Constitution).&nbsp;
Please be aware that the Senate has a strict attendance policy, so
please only run if you can commit to attending Senate meetings.<br>
<br>

from each grade) and two faculty members, all elected for a one-year
term. The purpose of the Board of Appeals is to address student and
teacher grievances. The Board of Appeals also handles Community Service
appeals.<br>
<br>
School Council Representative: One rising sophomore and one rising
junior are elected to serve a one-year and two-year term, respectively,
to the LHS School Council.&nbsp; The Council consists of parent,
faculty, student, and community representatives and serves as an
advisory committee to the administration and is responsible for
creating the annual School Improvement Plan.<br>
<br>

serve as a non-voting student delegate to the Lexington School
Committee.&nbsp; The School Committee is responsible for policy issues
at the district level and with the school budget process.<br>
