The Senate requests the assistant principal for student affairs, in
conjunction with the assistant principal for buildings and facilities
and the Senate school climate committee, to organize an anti-litter
campaign and to recommend to the senate a program that in the future
would substantially reduce this litter. The Senate requests that the
assistant principal for student affairs report back to the Senate
within three Senate meetings on his plans for an anti-litter campaign
and the process of the anti-litter program.<BR>

The sense of the Senate regarding the exclusivity of X-block is that
scheduling meetings during this time stands to infringe upon the
integrity of the Senate as a governing power.<BR>
The constitution states in article IV, section 3 that:<BR>
<B><I>C. The scheduling of practices, rehearsals, and other required
meetings is strictly prohibited during Senate meeting times.<BR>
E. No teacher shall be assigned any involuntary professional duty
while the Senate is in session.<BR>
</I></B>It is the feeling of the Senate that, in order to protect the
integrity of the Senate, clarification of Article IV, Section 3 C is
necessary. Therefore we have stated that:<BR>
<B><I>Any activity, extra-help or make-up session, detention,
practice, rehearsal, or meeting which is regularly scheduled and/or
offered only during X-block is considered in violation of the
Constitution.<BR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><U>Rationale</U><BR>
</FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Senate was created to act as a voice for the
students and faculty in the school community. While it is important
for school administrator to maintain the ability to crate school
policy, the opinions of students and faculty members reflected by the
Senate should be heard before decisions are made. Because of the
existence of other policy-making bodies, the Senate is often left
out, or is left to discuss extraneous issues and not focus on
concrete proposals for policy change. This bill facilitates
communication through policy and allows for an official record of
Senate opinions on all school decisions. In addition, this bill
creates a precedent for interaction between the Senate and the School
Council concerning issues that originate form the Council.
Principal's Note The term 'policy' in this bill refers to legislative
policy, not executive procedure. It will be up to the administration
to decide whether the changes they initiate are in fact policies
which must be reviewed by the Senate or merely executive revisions.
It should also be noted that the areas with which the Senate is
constituted to be involved or has been involved by practice may serve
as a guideline for such as decision.<BR>

have used c. Possession d. Intention or attempting to sell or
distribute e. Selling or distributing f. Possession of drug
paraphernalia.<BR>
2. For purposes of this policy alcohol and drugs include not only
alcohol, controlled substances as defined in Mass. Gen. Laws, Ch.
(4C(including but not limited to marijuana, cocaine and heroin), but
also restricted drugs which are misused; steroids; and products
misused for the purposes of mind altering effects (aerosols,
solvents, etc.)<BR>
3. Students who violate this policy will be subject to disciplinary
action up to and including expulsion as set fourth in Discipline -
School Guidelines.<BR>
4. The school will cooperate fully with the police to deal with
violations of the law on school property.<BR>
5. In addition to the rules and regulations outlined in this policy
governing all students at Lexington High School, students
participating in interscholastic sports will be responsible to the
rules and regulations of the MIAA.<BR>
6. Students who are suspected of being under the influence of a
substance or in possession of a substance on school grounds will be
referred to the Asst. Principal and in some cases to the school nurse
for assessment. If the situation warrants, parents will be notified
and requested to take the student home. Provisions related to search
and seizure and student discipline will also be followed. 7. If any
of the above regulations are violated either in school or outside of
school, the student will be referred to the Student Assistance Team.
However, the school is only allowed to take disciplinary action
against students for violations on school grounds or school sponsored
activities.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><U>Rationale</U><BR>
</FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">1. Any policy that attempts to govern Lexington
High School students should only be concerned with the governing of
students on school grounds, thus the current policy is the school
overstepping its jurisdiction of students.<BR>
2. It is the school's primary objective to educate students, not
punish students. This policy undermines the educational integrity of
the school in that it is not the school's responsibility to control,
enforce or attempt to provide repercussions for events that occur
outside of school or school related functions.<BR>
3. The current policy has created a double jeopardy issue in that
there are both legal and academic penalties for actions in one's
personal life outside of school.<BR>
4. As the current policy is now stated, it is unclear what
constitutes a &igrave;violation&icirc; off-campus.<BR>
5. Academic and extracurricular competency have no connection with
responsibility in students personal decision making. Until the
personal decision making on the students' part, or lack thereof,
enters into the extracurricular circle there should be no penalties
of this nature &#91;as stated in the current policy&#93; imposed by
the school.<BR>

perform work service in cleaning up the school instead of sitting in
the detention hall.<BR>
This option will be available to students providing the following
conditions exist:<BR>
</FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="+1">1. The students in detention hall choose
   this option of their own free will. No student assigned detention
   shall be compelled to perform work service.<BR>

   volunteers to supervise said work service.<BR>

   tasks.<BR>
   5. An outline of necessary services to be performed is provided
   either by the administration or the custodial staff to the
   teachers proctoring the detention hall.<BR>
   <BR>
   Students who agree to perform these tasks shall have their
   detention time reduced by one half. Therefore, a student with one
   hour of detention need perform only a half hour of work service to
   satisfy his/her detention requirement. Those with two hours may
   perform up to one hour of work service, though no student with one
   hour of detention need perform only a half hour of work service to
   satisfy his/her detention requirement. Those with two hours may
   perform up to one hour of work service, though no student may
   perform more the one hour of work service on a given day. Any
   student who chooses this option but then does not fulfill the
   assigned tasks to the satisfaction of the supervising teacher will
   have his/her name given to administration for appropriate
   punishment. Work service shall consist primarily of activities
   related to cleaning the campus area of LHS either inside and/or
   outside depending on the weather and the environmental needs of
   the school. This service may also consist of activities designed
   to beautify our school environment. Clerical duties or personal
   services will not qualify as work service in place of

<B>3-98 Policy Review Bill<BR>
</B>I. Any proposed changes to the written policy in the
Student/Parent Handbook the fall under the scope and jurisdiction of
the Senate (see Article VI Senate Constitution) must be submitted to
the Senate review prior to becoming official written
policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">II. Review will be defined as one of the
following:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">A. Consideration by the Senate of the proposed
change as a bill;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">B. Consideration by the Senate of the proposed
change as a resolution.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">III. Only the administration and the School
Council may make changes to the handbook without the approval of the
Senate. However, these parties must submit such changes to the Senate
before they can become policy. Such a submission will be reviewed in
the Senate as a resolution. The Senate reserves the right to amend,
alter, or rescind such policies in the form of a bill.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">IV. The Senate, if it chooses to discuss a
proposed change as a resolution by a majority, will have only two
meetings to discuss and vote on the resolution. A proposed change
that is either ignored by the Senate or not voted on within tow
Senate meetings may become policy.</FONT></P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Rationale</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Senate was created to act as a voice for the
students and faculty in the school community. While it is important
for school administrator to maintain the ability to crate school
policy, the opinions of students and faculty members reflected by the
Senate should be heard before decisions are made. Because of the
existence of other policy-making bodies, the Senate is often left
out, or is left to discuss extraneous issues and not focus on
concrete proposals for policy change. This bill facilitates
communication through policy and allows for an official record of
Senate opinions on all school decisions. In addition, this bill
creates a precedent for interaction between the Senate and the School
Council concerning issues that originate form the Council.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The term "policy" in this bill refers to
legislative policy, not executive procedure. It will be up to the
administration to decide whether the changes they initiate are in

executive revisions. It should also be noted that the areas with
which the Senate is constituted to be involved or has been involved
by practice may serve as a guideline for such as decision.</FONT></P>

      only alcohol, controlled substances as defined in Mass. Gen.
      Laws, Ch. (4C(including but not limited to marijuana, cocaine
      and heroin), but also restricted drugs which are misused;
      steroids; and products misused for the purposes of mind

   <P><FONT SIZE="+1">3. Students who violate this policy will be

   set fourth in Discipline - School Guidelines.<BR>
   4. The school will cooperate fully with the police to deal with
   violations of the law on school property.<BR>
   5. In addition to the rules and regulations outlined in this
   policy governing all students at Lexington High School, students
   participating in interscholastic sports will be responsible to the
   rules and regulations of the MIAA.<BR>
   6. Students who are suspected of being under the influence of a
   substance or in possession of a substance on school grounds will
   be referred to the Asst. Principal and in some cases to the school
   nurse for assessment. If the situation warrants, parents will be
   notified and requested to take the student home. Provisions
   related to search and seizure and student discipline will also be
   followed.<BR>
   7. If any of the above regulations are violated either in school
   or outside of school, the student will be referred to the Student
   Assistance Team. However, the school is only allowed to take
   disciplinary action against students for violations on school
   grounds or school sponsored activities.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Rationale</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">1. Any policy that attempts to govern Lexington
High School students should only be concerned with the governing of
students on school grounds, thus the current policy is the school
overstepping its jurisdiction of students.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">2. It is the school's primary objective to educate
students, not punish students. This policy undermines the educational
integrity of the school in that it is not the school's responsibility
to control, enforce or attempt to provide repercussions for events
that occur outside of school or school related functions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">3. The current policy has created a double
jeopardy issue in that there are both legal and academic penalties
for actions in one's personal life outside of school.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">4. As the current policy is now stated, it is
unclear what constitutes a "violation" off-campus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">5. Academic and extracurricular competency have no
connection with responsibility in students personal decision making.
Until the personal decision making on the students' part, or lack
thereof, enters into the extracurricular circle there should be no
penalties of this nature &#91;as stated in the current policy&#93;
imposed by the school.</FONT></P>

resolution fails to pass, the secretary will publish the vote count
in the minutes.</FONT></P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Rationale</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">It is important and useful to know what the
results of a vote on a bill or resolution were by number. This way, a
reader of the bill or resolution can have a better sense of the
feelings of the Senate without consulting Senate minutes. The results
of the vote can also help the principal in evaluating the feelings of
the Senate when making a decision to approve or veto a bill or when
considering a resolution.</FONT></P>

</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">A core value of an institution that seeks to
maintain high moral and ethical standards is the intolerance of
cheating in any form. Cheating undermines both the integrity of the
perpetrator as well as that of the school. In presenting a code of
conduct based on individual integrity and ethics, we aim to create a
vision of what we would like our community to be. The Honor Code
intends to reduce the level of unhealthy competition in the school by
shifting peer pressure away from cheating and toward ethical
behavior.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">1. The following will be considered
cheating*:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">a. The willful giving or receiving of an
unauthorized, dishonest, or unscrupulous advantage in academic
work.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">b. The above may be accomplished by any means
whatsoever, including, but not limited to, the following: fraud,
duress, deception, theft, talking, signs, gestures, copying from
another student, unauthorized collaboration, and the unauthorized use
of study aids, memoranda, books, electronic programs, data or other
information. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">c. Attempted Cheating.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">2. The following will be considered
plagiarism*:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">a. Presenting as one's own the words, the work, or
the opinions of someone else without prior acknowledgement.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">b. Borrowing the sequence of ideas, the
arrangement of material, or the pattern of thought of someone else
without proper acknowledgement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">3. If a student cheats or plagiarizes, she or he
may receive zero for the entire assignment and may not qualify for
make up of the assignment subject to the teacher's discretion. The
School reserves the right to assign additional penalties based on the
severity of the offense up to and including suspension or
expulsion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">4. In order to prevent misunderstandings, at the
beginning of each course the teacher will clarify what constitutes a
violation of the Honor Code in his/her class. This should include an
explanation of*:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">a. The extent to which collaboration or group
participation is permissible in preparing term papers, laboratory
exhibits or notebooks, reports of any kind, tests, quizzes,

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Report Card Bill (Passed January 26,
2001)</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The printing of report cards shall not contain
information regarding the distribution of grades within the classes
taken by the student. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Rationale</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">a. The current system promotes competition between
students and fosters a climate of stress.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Students spend enough time and energy trying to
figure out where they rank amongst their peers, and stress over the
competitive aspects of school and grades enough. We have already
abolished class rank; this proposal would be analogous to that with
regards to individual classes. Many students have confused
achievement with self-esteem. The grades should be taken as they are,
as fitting in with the student handbook definition of grades, and not
as comparison with other students.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">b. The current system helps to create and
perpetuate reputations of teachers. Teachers' grading patterns are
revealed, which has resulted in the creation of reputations. While
granting that these tendencies would eventually become general
knowledge anyhow, this provides a sense of factual backing for those
assumptions. As such, based on these reputations, students try to get
in or out of certain courses based on the relative ease or lack
thereof of obtaining a high grade. This creates problems for
teachers, students and guidance counselors. Teachers may be doing
excellent work in challenging, inspiring, and educating students, but
those students who focus on the grade focus on the results rather
than the means. Nor are these reputations necessarily
correct.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">c. The current system leads to incorrect analysis.
Each class is a unique entity with its own personality. Regarding the
many classes at certain levels, it must be noted that some classes
are stronger as a whole than others. For example, a Level I class
taught by one teacher may have many A and B grades and no C/D/F
grades due to the caliber of students placed into it, while another
Level 1 class taught by the same teacher has a high number of B and C
grades, with few A or D or F grades. Assignments, tests, essay
assignments and the like may all be the same, as is the grading
criteria.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">d. The current system creates tensions between
teachers. Upon being appraised of the grade breakdowns, teachers who
are statistically revealed as being "easy graders'" or "hard graders"
find themselves at odds with the rest of the teachers in the subject.
The simple fact is that there is no standardized grading system, and
that each teacher has his or her own requirements and criteria and
system for grading. Teachers who give too many high grades may feel
pressure from peers to tighten up on their criteria, while those who
give few high grades may feel pressure from peers (as well as
parents) to be more generous. When one teacher is more stringent or
lenient than the rest of the peers, resentment may ensue. (Teachers
are people too.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">e. The current system is incompatible with what is
written in the Student Handbook. From page 96 of the LHS Handbook
2000-2001: </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="+1">"We believe that grades should serve
   several goals:<BR>
   1. They should record and communicate achievement within an
   instructional level.<BR>
   2. They should serve as an incentive for students to work and
   achieve to their level of ability.<BR>
   3. They should differentiate among students on some clearly
   established and educationally meaningful basis."</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Clearly the first two items do not lend support to
the current system. However, the last one conceivably could be
interpreted as doing so. But all that statement does is point out
that there is in fact a system of defining what each grade actually
means, and in fact the bottom of page 96 and the top of page 97 lay
out what the letter grades, as well as "P" and "I", stand
for.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Teachers are required to tell students of their
grading policies. Teachers are not, however, required to tell
students of how many people fit the varying
differentiations.</FONT></P>

Resolution on Recent Senior Pranks</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">We, the Lexington High School Student-Faculty
Senate, deplore the recent series of senior pranks that have been
perpetrated upon the Lexington High School community and specifically
upon the privacy of our principal, Dr. Van Seasholes. We understand
that there has been a long tradition of senior practical jokes each
spring before graduation, but we find this year's actions to be
extremely mean spirited. We are particularly upset at those which
were directed against Dr. Seasholes seemingly as a result of his
taking the necessary disciplinary action to punish the perpetrators
of the pranks at the high school. Although the actions of a few
should not reflect upon the upstanding behavior of most students at
LHS, we believe that the recent pranks cross a serious line and
ultimately reflect badly upon the student body as a whole at
Lexington High School. Therefore, this resolution is intended to
publicly condemn the actions of those students involved.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><A NAME="3-02"></A><B>3-02 Senate Resolution on
Approved Bills</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">It shall be the responsibility of the Senate
Communications Committee in conjunction with the Senate Executive
Committee to inform all members of the Lexington High School
community when a bill has been passed by the Senate and either
approved or not disapproved by the Principal. It will likewise be the
responsibility of these committees to inform the school community
when a bill passed by the Senate has been reinstituted over a
principal's disapproval. Full text of such passed bills (with or
without the rationale) will be read over the announcements and posted
on the bulletin board in the main hall within ten days of its
passage. In addition, full text and rationale of each passed bill
will be e-mailed via the school-wide server to all staff members
within ten days of its passage. In addition, each constituency shall
be informed as to exactly when said bill shall officially become
school policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Rationale</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">1. Although the Senate Secretary posts Senate
meeting minutes on the school e-mail system not all staff members or
students read these.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">2. The Senate cannot and should not rely solely on
the administration to inform members of the school community when a
passed bill has instituted or changed a school policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">3. It will be much easier to enforce a policy
change made by the Senate if everyone in the school community is
informed of such changes in a timely fashion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">4. Some policy changes made by the Senate have
never been fully enforced due to lack of information about those
changes.</FONT></P>

to the Minuteman regarding the override</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">6/11/03</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">At our June 12, 2003 meeting, we, the Lexington
High School Student-Faculty Senate, passed the following resolution
in response to voters&iacute; recent rejection of the tax
override.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">LHS will be impacted directly by the vote against
the override in many ways. Presently, one projected budget cut is the
equivalent of three existing teaching positions. Some classes,
especially in the foreign language and social studies departments,
are already filled to capacity. Losing teachers on top of being
unable to hire new ones to meet enrollment increases will greatly
affect teachers&iacute; workloads and students&iacute; classroom
experiences. Among other cutbacks, LHS will lose a dean, a secretary,
and a custodian next year. The physical education and art departments
are particularly susceptible to cutbacks, and are likely to lose
faculty positions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Needless to say, the general opinion of the Senate
on the vote is negative. We recognize that a tax increase during hard
economic times is less than appealing to most voters, but the high
quality of its public schools makes Lexington the valued community
that it is. The students among us are deeply appreciative of the
programs, teachers, administrators, and faculty that make our
experience at LHS a valuable one. We regret our town&iacute;s
decision to reduce its support for our school and its faculty.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><A NAME="4-02"></A><B>Senate Resolution on
Approved Bills</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">It shall be the responsibility of the Senate
Communications Committee in conjunction with the Senate Executive
Committee to inform all members of the Lexington High School
community when a bill has been passed by the Senate and either
approved or not disapproved by the Principal. It will likewise be the
responsibility of these committees to inform the school community
when a bill passed by the Senate has been reinstituted over a
principal's disapproval. Full text of such passed bills (with or
without the rationale) will be read over the announcements and posted
on the bulletin board in the main hall within ten days of its
passage. In addition, full text and rationale of each passed bill
will be e-mailed via the school-wide server to all staff members
within ten days of its passage. In addition, each constituency shall
be informed as to exactly when said bill shall officially become
school policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Rationale</B><BR>
1. Although the Senate Secretary posts Senate meeting minutes on the
school e-mail system not all staff members or students read
these.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">2. The Senate cannot and should not rely solely on
the administration to inform members of the school community when a
passed bill has instituted or changed a school policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">3. It will be much easier to enforce a policy
change made by the Senate if everyone in the school community is
informed of such changes in a timely fashion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">4. Some policy changes made by the Senate have
never been fully enforced due to lack of information about those
changes.</FONT></P>

Bill</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Commencing with the next scheduled Senate meeting,
each committee chair (or designee) will formally report the
attendance at the previous committee meeting. These reports of
committee attendance will be communicated to the Secretary and placed

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Rationale: Attendance at committee meetings is
important and necessary in order for the Senate to properly attend to
its responsibilities. Official, public reporting of a
Senator&Igrave;s attendance at both Senate and committee meetings
provides the electorate the opportunity to have this information.
This approach to committee attendance is public, straightforward,
easy to administer, and not punitive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><A NAME="2-03"></A><B>2-03</B> <B>Honor Code
Reporting And Awareness Bill</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Teachers, in consultation with their department
heads, will report substantial breaches of the Lexington High School
(LHS) Honor Code for which a student incurs academic or disciplinary
consequences to the student's dean and counselor. Each incident will
be recorded and held in strict confidence by the dean and counselor
except when necessary to report to the Board of Appeals.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The accumulation of more than one breach will be
interpreted as a pattern of intellectual dishonesty and will result
in an automatic one day suspension. Students have the right to appeal
this ruling via the Board of Appeals as per the LHS constitution. The
Board will determine if the student's record constitutes a pattern of
intellectual dishonesty, where a pattern is defined as multiple
breaches of the LHS Honor Code. In making its determination the Board
will require input from both the reporting teacher(s) and accused
student. If the board finds that there is such a pattern, it must
recommend disciplinary action. The board will weigh heavily the
character of the breaches when deciding what disciplinary action(s)
to recommend.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">This bill places no limits on the current LHS
Honor Code, which allows for individual breaches of the code to be
met with the full range of disciplinary consequences, up to and
including expulsion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">At the beginning of each school year, in homeroom,
every student will be furnished with a printed copy of the LHS Honor
code and this bill. Students will be provided adequate time in a
supervised environment to read the code and the terms of the
reporting bill and ask questions about them. Then each student will
be required to sign a form which indicates that he or she has read
the code and understands the terms of it and the potential penalties
as well a his or her rights of appeal if accused of a violation. This
form will not be construed as an acknowledgment by each student that
he or she will abide by the code, though it is the school's hope that
they will. It will only be a formal certification that they
understand the code and the consequences of violating it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Rationale</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Anecdotal evidence suggests that clear breaches of
the LHS Honor Code are not incurring official disciplinary action.
Additionally, student breaches of the honor code appear to occur with
an unsettling frequency.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">This bill provides for the collection of
quantifiable data on student behavior and allows students with a
pattern of intellectual dishonesty to be identified and appropriate
action to be taken. Currently, many infractions of thehonor code are
handled informally, by providing a zero on the assignment, etc.. this
now means that no record of the infraction be taken. Currently, many
infractions of the honor code are handled informally, by providing a
zero on the assignment, etc. This now means that no record of the
infraction exists. Without such a record it is conceivable that one
could incur multiple infractions across classes and grade
levels.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Acts of intellectual dishonesty adversely affect
the entirely of the Lexington community. Therefore, the consequences
for such behavior should be appropriately stern.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Although LHS has had an honor code on record for a
number of years which is printed in the Student handbook each year,
few students really know of its existence, understand the terms of it
or have had an opportunity to ask questions about it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Passage of this bill may result in serious
consequences for violating the honor code. Therefore, students should
have clear understanding of what is in the code and should formally
acknowledge that they have read it and understand what may occur if
they violate it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">No honor code can be effective unless that
organization which adopts it (in this case the LHS Student Faculty
Senate) does everything in its power to inform its constituency of
the code's existence and the potential consequences for violating
it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Using the Board of Appeals as the mediating agent
in any dispute over a potential honor code violation will serve to
give that agency some long overdue power and
responsibility.</FONT></P>

<B><a name=2007-1>2007-1 Poster Bill</a></B></FONT></P>
		<br>Passed on October 24, 2007

<br>Students and faculty may place posters for school or club related events and meetings on interior walls and on the end sections of lockers throughout the LHS campus. Such notices are to be hung with masking tape only. Posters may not be placed on glass, in stairwells, or on, or within five feet of, any egress door (all classroom exits, doors to halls, stairwells and the outside).  Posters must be approved and initialed by the activity's faculty advisor or a dean, who will ensure that not more than fifty posters will be hung. All posters must have a date of removal on them unless they refer to a specific event, and posterers are expected to remove posters immediately after the event or on the specified date. All possible efforts will be made to recycle the posters.

<br>It is the Climate Committee's responsibility to identify and maintain an area or areas, approved by the Administration, including the current free postering area in Commons I, for posters not related to school activities.  Posters may be placed in this area by students, faculty and staff, and need no faculty or dean's signature or removal date. It is expected that the community will show good judgment in selecting the quantity and size of posters placed in this area so that all messages can be accommodated.

<br>In addition, the Climate Committee will promote good poster behavior throughout the school and communicate when possible with violators of this bill.

<br><br>Rationale
<br>1. This bill modifies the 2004 Bill Billboard Bill in three ways.  

<br>a.  It specifies a maximum number of posters allowed in the halls and commons areas.  There are twelve main halls in the school and two commons areas.  Three or four posters per hall and in each of the commons areas are sufficient to guarantee that all students will see a poster often.  Within this limit students may choose to spread their allotment of posters in a non-uniform manner.  Generally fewer posters will be sufficient.

<br>b.  It restricts placement of posters in conformance with fire code.

<br>c.  It directs the Climate Committee take leadership in maintaining the provisions of this bill throughout the school, not just in the free postering areas.

<br>2.  The 2004 Bill Billboard Bill was never inserted into the Student Handbook, although it was written by the Climate Committee in consultation with the principal and, in accordance with the Senate Constitution, approved by him as school policy.  In spite of this oversight the current administration operates with the understanding that the Bill Billboard Bill is current school policy.

<br>3.  The 2004 Bill Billboard Bill and this improved bill include certain student rights which the former policy does not, and these rights should be made manifest each year.  We update here the rationale of the 2004 bill:
"Postering is an important right of free speech which benefits the LHS community. This bill is intended to preserve that right to the greatest extent possible.  It is expected that posters may be provocative and even offensive to some, but that no personal attacks or hate speech will be tolerated."

 <B><a name=2008-1>2008-1 Transcript Bill</a></B></FONT></P>

<br>On student transcripts the number of hours of community service completed will no longer be recorded.  Instead transcripts will read "Community Service graduation requirement completed:  yes/no" indicating whether the student has completed the required hours of community service.

<br><br>Rationale

<br>1.  The community service requirement states a minimum number of hours of service.  The school has no basis for evaluating whether more hours represent better or more socially useful service.  Students should not be encouraged to add more and more hours to their transcripts simply because the transcript records these hours.

<br>2.  Students who perform the minimal number of hours should not be made to look inferior to those who have performed more than the minimum hours, yet admission officers may draw this conclusion in comparing students from this high school.

<br>3.  Students who feel that their service is extraordinary can tell this to admissions officers in their application process.

<br><b><FONT size="+1">2010-1 Arts and Humanities Fundraising Access Bill</FONT></b>
 
<br>To allow for more access to fundraising opportunities, the Arts and Humanities Hallway will be available for after-school fundraising activities (i.e. bake sales, etc) as follows:

<br>I.	Student organizations will comply with the fundraising policy in the Student/Parent handbook and the District Activities Manual:

<br>"All fund-raising activities...involving students, individual classes or school-connected organizations, for whatever purpose, must be discussed fully with a Dean and advisor of the organizations before they begin."

<br>II.	All other student organizations may schedule no more than one after-school fundraiser per week and will submit requests for fundraiser spots at least one week in advance and no more than four weeks in advance.

<br>III.	To promote accessibility, student organizations that have scheduled fewer prior fundraisers that year will have priority. 

<br><br><u>Rationale:</u>
 
<br>As reported in the Social Action Committee's Fundraising Opportunity Report for 2009-2010, a small handful of clubs account for a majority of the fundraisers. Currently, it is difficult for some groups to schedule fundraisers mid-way through the school year due to certain groups scheduling fundraisers months in advance.
<br>This bill intends to formalize the process of scheduling fundraisers in the arts and humanities hallway.
<br>Article II promotes easier access for groups that want to start fundraising midway through the year.
<br>Article III will prevent excessive 'monopolizing" of fundraising spots.

<br><br><b><FONT size="+1"><a name=2010-2>2010-2 Discussion Efficiency Resolution</a></FONT></b><br>
 
Let it be resolved that when new bills and documents are to be presented before the Senate, they will:<br>
-Be distributed in print to all Senators at the Senate meeting at least one week before they are intended to be discussed.<br>
-Even after the bill is distributed, the author retains the right to amend the bill as necessary prior to formal discussion of the bill.<br>
-Bill authors will be able to explain the bill and its rationale briefly during open comments on the date of distribution.<br>
-Have the author's e-mail address (or some form of contact information) documented at the bottom of the bill draft.<br>
-Be submitted to the Policy Committee for consideration the Monday of the week before the date of distribution of copies of the bill to the Senate.<br>


<br><u>Rationale:</u><br>
 
-The current system of having bills and documents distributed to Senators through the FirstClass system has proven to be an ineffective means of allowing Senators to ponder topics before the actual Senate meeting.<br>
-Having a week to consider a discussion item on one's own time or with committees before it is to be officially discussed in a Senate meeting is a vital part of the discussion process, as forethought allows for Senators to develop discussion points to make meetings more efficient and effective.<br>
-The author's e-mail address on documents will allow Senators to contact each other outside of meetings.<br>
-Lastly, the Policy Committee's primary function of bill review has been previously neglected, and should be practiced. Providing a copy of the bill the Monday two weeks before scheduled Senate discussion date will give the Policy Committee ample time to review and refine the bill.<br>

<u>Rationale:</u><br>
1. Opening up classroom computers would reduce traffic and occupancy in the library.<br>

3. Students will have greater work efficiency with easier access to computers.<br>

The committee will create its mission statement and will be required to report back to the Student-Faculty Senate annually. The head of the high school's food service will serve as advisor.<br><br>

<u>Rationale:</u><br>
A cafeteria advisory committee is in the best interest of the food provider and the students. Because students are the customers of the food provider, the food provider can expect increased business as a result of increased student input. Students gain from having a greater voice of cafeteria matters, as the committee will facilitate improvements of the dining experience of students. Having the advisory committee as an elected body ensures that its spots will be filled and that its members will take their positions seriously.<br>

After the election, every student Senator will be assigned 2-4 homerooms of the same graduation year (when possible including their own HR).

[Passed April 13, 2011]

<br><br><b><FONT size="+1"><a name=2010-10>2010-10 Community Service Improvement Bill</a></FONT></b><br>

The Senate requests that homeroom teachers and counselors, at least twice a year, discuss with each of their students his or her progress in meeting the school goal of ten hours of Community Service a year and in filing paperwork according to the deadlines stated below.  Students should state specific plans for achieving their yearly goals.  Community service should be celebrated in homerooms and students should be encouraged to help each other to complete their obligations.<br><br>

Completed Community Service forms must be submitted to the Community Service Secretary within the quarter following the last date on which the service was performed. Hours completed in the summer must be submitted by the end of the first quarter.<br><br>

Hours rejected solely due to late filing will be credited if the following occurs:<br>
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;The student appears at a meeting of the Board of Appeals no later than the quarter following the rejection of the service, with paperwork approved for the type and hours of service.<br>
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;The student, in discussion with the Board, reflects on the service performed and its meaning to the student.<br>
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;The Board votes to grant the credit, based on the satisfactory completion of 1. and 2.<br><br>

In order to facilitate a transition to a consistently enforced school policy, all students have until the end of Quarter 1, 2011-2012 to submit to the Community Service secretary paperwork for service performed at any prior time during their high school career, and this service will not be rejected for lateness.<br><br>

It is suggested that the Board of Appeals meet on the same day as Attendance appeals for the convenience of scheduling and announcements. The Board of Appeals will establish any procedures necessary to carry out this new task.<br><br>

The Community Service secretary shall keep a record of student hours rejected for late filing and each student's homeroom teacher and guidance counselor shall be informed of these hours.<br><br> 

The Student Handbook should be updated to describe the relevant provisions of this bill.<br><br>

The Senate will provide quarterly reminders through homeroom announcements to students to fulfill their Community Service and file their paperwork in a timely fashion.<br><br>

The Senate will evaluate the success of this new policy in one year.<br><br> 

<u>Rationale</u><br>
1.&nbsp;The Senate commends the administration and counselors for working with upper class students in danger of failing to complete their community service, and commends the Community Service Secretary for posting periodic reminders of deadlines in homeroom announcements.<br><br>

Nevertheless, this is insufficient support for students. The community service requirement and firm deadlines for filing forms are justified only if the faculty supports students in their efforts.  This support must be ongoing so that students perform their service in a meaningful and reflective way and report their service in a timely fashion.<br><br>

The Senate created the Community Service requirement and the faculty voted to continue it when it created the current school Mission Statement.  The Senate cannot command the faculty to support students but it is the intent of this bill to suggest that it has a moral obligation to provide the same level of support that is given to students who have long term assignments in academic courses, namely with:<br>	
&nbsp;A requirement for students to have a plan for achieving their goals.<br>
&nbsp;Periodic check-ins.<br>
&nbsp;Recognition of ongoing success.<br><br>

This obligation falls naturally upon homeroom teachers and counselors and time for them to carry out their work should be provided by the administration, perhaps with extended homeroom periods.<br><br>

2.&nbsp;From the recommendations of the Community Service Report of 2006:<br>
"..., the committee believes the program cannot be successful without the voluntary commitment of faculty and students. Specifically, faculty and students must seek out students who are disengaged from this process, and encourage timely group participation in service to the community."<br><br>

3.&nbsp;<a href ="#4-88">Senate Bill 4-88</a> specifies certain procedures for the Board of Appeals to follow which may need to be modified to hear Community Service appeals.  The Board is hereby authorized to exercise its judgment in making these modifications.<br><br>

<br><b><FONT size="+1">2011-2 Class Council Community Service Bill</FONT></b>
 
<br><br>All class councils at Lexington High School shall be required to sponsor at least one event over the course of each academic year organized specifically for the purpose of contributing to a community service effort and open to class members.  The activity chosen by each class may be used to meet the community service graduation requirement.  Class Councils must submit a plan to meet this requirement to the Senate Social Action Committee by February 1 of each year, and must complete the project by June 1 and submit a report to the Social Action Committee by that date.

<br><br>This bill replaces the <a href="#589">5-89 Class Service Project Bill</a>.

<br><br><u>Rationale:</u>
<br>The Senate currently feels that community service should by rewarded by community service credit.

<br><b><FONT size="+1">2011-3 Substitute Teacher Testing Resolution</FONT></b>
 
<br><br>Recognizing the constitutional restriction forbidding the Student/Faculty Senate from legislating how teachers organize their courses and evaluate their students, but observing the need for all students to have equal and fair opportunities for evaluation,

<br><br><u>The Student/Faculty Senate hereby resolves that faculty members should not give major exams or tests on days when they are absent and the class is being taught by a substitute teacher.</u>

<br><br><u>Rationale:</u>
<br><ol>
<li>When teachers choose to postpone tests, they often begin teaching curriculum that will be included in the next assessment, aware that students need to continue working even if their evaluation is delayed.  If a substitute teacher is present, the teacher could leave alternative work for the students, with the assumption that they will check the work upon their return and/or that the students will be responsible for that material on the next unit's assessment.</li>

<li>When substitute teachers are responsible for giving tests, they are often not aware of special testing accommodations given to individual students, and are less able to make decisions regarding a student's need to take the assessment on a different day or receive other accommodations (e.g. typing an essay instead of handwriting it).</li>

<li>Substitute teachers are unable to answer students' inquiries regarding confusing test questions covering material the student comprehends. Substitutes therefore cannot give the clarification that a teacher might provide, and so the student might not receive credit for material they understand.</li>

<li>Cheating is more likely to occur when a teacher is not present to supervise as a class takes a test. The presence of a teacher during administration of an assessment greatly discourages violations of the LHS Honor Code.</li>
<li>The Student/Faculty Senate's <a href="#1094">Junior-Senior Substitute Bill (10-94)</a> allows for teachers to cancel classes composed solely of upperclassmen in the event of the teacher's absence, provided they feel students could use the time productively and the teacher leaves an assignment for the students.  While teachers may sometimes feel it is not advantageous to cancel class, this option provides teachers with an additional alternative to giving a major assessment in a class taught by a substitute.</li>
</ol>
